- **Circuit Solver:** Includes MATLAB code to solve circuits using MATLAB's circuit analysis capabilities.
- **GUI Development:** Showcases GUI development using MATLAB's graphical user interface tools.I developed Simple Calculator, Slider and Text editor.
- **Signal Processing:** 
   - ****Continuous to Discrete Signal Conversion:** Code examples for converting continuous signals to discrete signals.
   - **Generation and Manipulation of Basic Signals:** Examples of generating and manipulating ramp, step, exponential, sine, and cosine signals.
   - **Fourier Transform:** MATLAB code for performing Fourier transform, fast Fourier transform (FFT), and inverse Fourier transform on signals.
   - **Spectrum Generation:** Code samples for generating spectra and separating them using bandpass filters.

- **Image Processing:** 
  - **Image Enhancement:** MATLAB code for basic image enhancement techniques, including contrast adjustment, grayscale conversion, and noise reduction.
  - **Image Segmentation:** Examples of image segmentation algorithms implemented in MATLAB.

- **Antenna Design:** 
  - **Microstrip Antenna for WLAN Application:** MATLAB code and designs for microstrip antennas used in WLAN applications.
  - **Fractal Antenna Design:** MATLAB code and examples for designing and developing fractal antennas.
